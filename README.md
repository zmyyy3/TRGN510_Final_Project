## Overview of project:
----------------------
* Due to high resolution, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a critical method for analyzing differential gene expression. For this project, RNA-seq data would be a great choice. The races of Whites and Asians are the two variables in this project. Therefore, the RNA-seq data file in the HT-seq format for melanoma in Whites and Asians will be analyzed in the project.
* The objective is to use the Bioconductor in R to analyze the differential gene expression of melanoma in Whites and Asians.

## Data:
------------
All of the data files are obtained from [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)

## Milestone 1:
----------------
* Start to screen the data that meets the requirements from the website of GDC Data Portal; download ten datasets in the HT-seq format of melanoma in Whites and ten datasets in the HT-seq format of melanoma in Asians; import these datasets into R to process and integrate the data.

## Milestone 2:
----------------
* Perform differential expression analysis on different data sets created in milestone 1 and get some plots and graphs.

## Deliverable:
----------------
R MarkDown
